# PRODUCTION SETUP
# CONNECTOR is deployed using the latest container image in
# docker hub (https://cloud.docker.com/u/encresearch/repository/docker/encresearch/mqtt-connector).
# If a new :latest image is pushed, watchtower will automatically shutdown the container currently
# running, update it and re-deploy it.
